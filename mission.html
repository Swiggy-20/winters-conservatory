            <h2>Mission Statement:</h2>
            <p>Winter's Conservatory is a non-profit organization to rehome dolphins that cannot be released back into the ocean.  Whether a dolphin may not have developed the necessary skills to survive out in the wide, or their injuries are significant enough to where thy are unable to return, Winter's Conservatory is a place for those dolphins to live our their lives safely and comfortably.</p>
            <p>This non-profit was created in memory of Winter, a dolphin rehomed in the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, after faving to have her tail amputated due to bycatch.  Our goal is to give as many dolphins as possible a good and comfortable life, just like Winter.</p>
