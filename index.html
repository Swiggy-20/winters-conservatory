            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Winter's conservatory is a sage home for dolphins that cannot return back into the ocean.  As a fictional partner with Clearwater Marine Aquarium, Winter's Conservatory is a non-profit organization that hosts dolphins from all over the country.  Winter's Conservatory was created in memory of Winter: The dolphin with the first prosthetic tail.  Thanks to Winter and many scientists and engineers, we are able to help dolphins and give them a good life.  Winter's Conservatory is located in Clearwater, Florida, USA.</p>
